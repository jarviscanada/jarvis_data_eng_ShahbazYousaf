  "summary": "I recently graduated with a Bachelor of Engineering, majoring in Computer Engineering from Toronto Metropolitan University, formerly Ryerson. Throughout my time at Ryerson, I honed my coding, problem-solving, and analytical skills through various courses and projects. My interest in software and data engineering, as well as devops, grew during my exploration of related electives. I expanded my knowledge with courses such as Engineering Algorithms and Data Structures, Fundamentals of Data Engineering, Operating Systems, and Introduction to Machine Learning. My interest in data engineering led me to a data science internship at Ansys, where I used tools like PySpark and Azure Databricks to improve the data processing within the APIP analytics system. In my final year, my capstone team and I developed a full-stack ML app, a job recommender system. This project utilized ReactJS, Django, a MySQL Server database for storing resume and job description datasets, and Python for ML and data processing scripts. I'm passionate about data engineering and devops, always learning and expanding my skills. I've completed certifications like IBM Applied DevOps Engineering and IBM Applied Data Science Professional. Currently, I'm learning AWS and aiming for the Cloud Practitioner and Solutions Architect certifications. I consider myself disciplined, highly motivated, and adaptable, thriving both independently and within a team. I enjoy challenges that push my technical and leadership abilities, viewing them as opportunities for growth. Beyond tech, my interests include basketball, strength training, MMA, gaming, and cooking/baking. Regularly engaging in these activities keeps me balanced and focused. In summary, I believe my drive, passion, and strong academic background position me as an excellent fit for your team as a Data or DevOps engineer."
