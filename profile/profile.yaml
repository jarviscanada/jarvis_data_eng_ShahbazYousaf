summary: I recently graduated with a Bachelor of Engineering, majoring in Computer Engineering from Toronto Metropolitan University, formerly Ryerson. Throughout my time at Ryerson, I honed my coding, problem-solving, and analytical skills through various courses and projects. I developed a keen interest in data engineering and devops as I delved into topics like algorithms, data structures, operating systems, data engineering and machine learning. This lead me to my data science internship at Ansys, where I was working on big data processing. In my final year, I worked on a full-year capstone project in which I built a full-stack ML job recommender application. I have completed multiple certifications such as IBM Applied DevOps Engineering and IBM Data Science, reflecting my passion for continuous learning and skill enhancement. I consider myself disciplined, highly motivated, and adaptable, thriving both independently and within a team. I enjoy challenges that push my technical and leadership abilities, viewing them as opportunities for growth. Beyond tech, my interests include basketball, strength training, MMA, and cooking. Regularly engaging in these activities keeps me balanced and focused.

    description: Built a monitoring system that records hardware specs and monitors real-time server usage and stores the data in a PostgreSQL database. The purpose of the collected data is to aid users in future resource planning, ie adding or removing servers, optimizing underused servers with more software and apps, or acquiring new servers to reduce the load on overused ones. Developed bash scripts to collect hardware and server data collection, used Docker for PostgreSQL provisioning and deployment, and leveraged Git and GitHub for version control. Configured crontab to run host_usage.sh script every minute, automating data collection. 
  - name: "Java Grep Application"
    git_url: "https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_ShahbazYousaf/tree/master/core_java/grep"
    description: Developed a Java grep app mimicking Linux bash grep command, allowing users to search for matching strings in files. The application recursively searches a root directory based on a provided regex pattern, identifies matching lines, and saves them to a user-specified output file. Utilizing Docker, the app can be easily implemented by pulling the image from DockerHub. Technologies used in the project include Java, Maven, Intellij, Lambda & Stream API, and Docker.
  - name: "Python Data Analytics"
    git_url: "https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_ShahbazYousaf/tree/master/python_data_analytics/"
    description: Collaborated with London Gift Shop, a UK-based retailer, to analyze customer behavior and diagnose revenue stagnation. Utilized Jupyter notebooks, Python, Numpy, matplotlib and pandas for analysis, generating insights on invoice distributions, monthly orders, and transaction patterns. These findings guided the marketing team in developing new marketing strategies to boost LGS's business.
