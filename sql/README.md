###### Table Setup (DDL)

###### Question 1: The club is adding a new facility - a spa. We need to add it into the facilities table. Use the following values: facid: 9, Name: 'Spa', membercost: 20, guestcost: 30, initialoutlay: 100000, monthlymaintenance: 800. 

```sql
insert into cd.facilities (facid, name, membercost, guestcost, initialoutlay, monthlymaintenance) 
values (9, 'Spa', 20, 30, 100000, 800);
```

###### Questions 2: Let's try adding the spa to the facilities table again. This time, though, we want to automatically generate the value for the next facid, rather than specifying it as a constant. Use the following values for everything else: Name: 'Spa', membercost: 20, guestcost: 30, initialoutlay: 100000, monthlymaintenance: 800.

```sql
SELECT blah blah 
```
